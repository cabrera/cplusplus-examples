# Introduction

This is a collection of C++ programming examples. It is meant to serve as a
tutorial to many of the features available in either the C++ core language, the
C++ standard library, or even some major, open-source, external libraries.

Currently, this repository focuses on C++11. In the future, more examples may be
added.
